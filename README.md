# Quantum-SphereDeconding

An investigation into the possibility of applying the quantum speed ups for tree search algorithms found by Montanaro [1, 2] to the sphere decoding algorithm [3].

- Currently just a classical implementation (unfinished).
- Plan to implement posible quantum algorithm using Cirq initially.
- This will be followed up by running algorithm on IBM Q.
- Complexity analysis to follow.
